Overview
This project provides a hands-on approach to text classification using RNNs, applied to the IMDb movie reviews dataset. It includes multiple Jupyter notebooks for different stages of model building: data preprocessing, embedding visualization, model training, and testing. Additionally, a Streamlit app (app.py) is provided for deploying the model, allowing users to interactively test the model with custom input.

Features
Embedding Visualization: A notebook dedicated to generating and exploring word embeddings, which represent words as dense vectors. This enables the RNN to learn relationships between words based on context.
Sentiment Classification with RNN: The project uses a Recurrent Neural Network to classify reviews as positive or negative. RNNs are well-suited for sequence data, making them ideal for text-based tasks.
Streamlit Deployment: The app.py script offers a simple Streamlit app for deploying the model, where users can enter text and receive predictions. This approach makes the model accessible via a user-friendly web interface.
Modular Design: Each stage of the model-building process is separated into different notebooks, making it easier to understand and modify each component.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+: Ensure Python is installed.
Required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.
Steps to Set Up
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shivamlko9832/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download IMDb Dataset: The dataset is required for model training. This dataset can typically be loaded directly from libraries like TensorFlow Datasets within the notebooks.

Usage
Running Notebooks for Training and Evaluation
Model Training: Open Text Classification.ipynb in a Jupyter environment. This notebook includes all the necessary steps for data loading, preprocessing, and training the RNN model. Model performance can be evaluated on a test set within this notebook.
Embedding Exploration: Use Embedding.ipynb to understand the embedding layer and visualize word relationships. This helps in interpreting how the model views text data.
Prediction Testing: prediction.ipynb contains code to test the trained model’s predictions on new, unseen data.
Model Deployment
Once the model is trained and saved, you can deploy it as a Streamlit app:

Run the Streamlit App:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This command launches a local web app powered by Streamlit. The app takes a text review as input and provides a sentiment prediction, allowing users to interact with the model in real-time.

Model Details
This project leverages a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture optimized for binary classification tasks. Key aspects of the model include:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vector representations, allowing the model to learn word relationships based on context.
RNN Layer: The recurrent layer processes the text data sequentially, enabling it to capture the temporal structure of sentences.
Output Layer: The final layer provides binary classification (positive/negative sentiment) based on learned patterns in the text data.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the IMDb dataset, which is widely used for sentiment analysis tasks, achieving competitive accuracy for binary classification.
Deployment
Streamlit Application
The deployment process uses Streamlit, a tool that simplifies the creation of data web apps. Running app.py launches a web application where users can input text and receive a sentiment classification. This deployment method is ideal for rapid prototyping and sharing with users who need a simple interface for interacting with the model.

Instructions to Deploy
Run:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Interact: Once the app launches, enter text in the input field to see the sentiment prediction result instantly.
Results
The RNN model shows strong performance on the IMDb dataset, with results detailed in Text Classification.ipynb. The model is capable of distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments, making it useful for sentiment analysis applications. For detailed metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, please refer to the evaluation section in the notebook.
